# VantageCloud Lake infographics

## What VantageCloud Lake is

VantageCloud Lake (VCL or Lake) is the Teradata cloud-native database. It is ideal for both data lakehouses and data warehouses. Furthermore, Lake is built to optimise cost storage while speeding up the response to your critical queries. Teradata offers Lake on the three leading Service Cloud Providers: AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform.

Note that Lake offers the complete set of Teradata analytic functions for Machine Learning, Data Science, and traditional reporting in a bundle called ClearScape Analytics.

## Lake infographics: the content of this repository

I gather high-resolution infographics, cheat sheets and other assets in this repository, each dedicated to explaining a VantageCloud **Lake** feature or the different setup options.

I published every asset in separate posts on [my blog](https://celiamuriel.com/) with further details. You have below a list with every article and a summary of its content:
* [VantageCloud Lake in a Nutshell](https://celiamuriel.com/vantagecloud-lake-in-a-nutshell/) summarises the critical VantageCloud Lake elements and the basis for using them for a quick start. The post shows the [VantageCloud Lake in a Nutshell infographic](https://github.com/CeliaMuriel/VantageCloud-Lake-infographics/blob/main/VantageCloud%20Lake%20in%20a%20Nutshell.jpg).
* [Flow in VantageCloud Lake - Cookbook to Make it Work in AWS](https://github.com/CeliaMuriel/VantageCloud-Lake-infographics/blob/main/Flow%20in%20VantageCloud%20Lake%20-%20Cookbook%20to%20Make%20it%20Work%20in%20AWS.pdf) gathers all my lessons learnt the first time I used Flow. You can learn more about Flow in the post [Flow in VantageCloud Lake: From Bust to Boom in Data Ingestion to Insights](https://celiamuriel.com/flow-in-vantagecloud-lake-from-bust-to-boom-in-data-ingestion-to-insights/).
* [Teradata VaaS on AWS: Network configuration](https://celiamuriel.com/vantagecloud-lake-on-aws-network-configuration/) shows a cheat sheet, [VantageCloud Lake on AWS - Network cheat sheet](https://github.com/CeliaMuriel/VantageCloud-Lake-infographics/blob/main/VantageCloud%20Lake%20on%20AWS_Network%20cheat%20sheet.jpg), which gives the main network elements you need to connect with your VantageCloud Lake on AWS. The post also explains those network elements in detail.
* [Teradata VaaS on Azure: Network configuration](https://celiamuriel.com/vantagecloud-lake-on-azure-network-configuration/) includes a cheat sheet, [VantageCloud Lake on Azure - Network cheat sheet](https://github.com/CeliaMuriel/VantageCloud-Lake-infographics/blob/main/VantageCloud%20Lake%20on%20Azure_Network%20cheat%20sheet.jpg), which gives the main network elements you need to connect with your VantageCloud Lake on Azure. The post also explains the network elements in detail.
* [Impact of Scaling Compute Clusters in VantageCloud Lake](https://celiamuriel.com/impact-of-scaling-compute-clusters-in-vantagecloud-lake/) explains the benefits you get by scaling the Compute Clusters up/ down or out/ in. The post contains the [infographic summarising the impact of choosing one or the other scaling option](https://github.com/CeliaMuriel/VantageCloud-Lake-infographics/blob/main/Impact%20of%20Scaling%20Compute%20Clusters%20in%20VantageCloud%20Lake.jpg).

This repository doesn't include an exhaustive list of all Lake configuration options and features, but it gathers the assets I made when needed.
