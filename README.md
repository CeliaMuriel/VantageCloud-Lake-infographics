# VantageCloud Lake infographics

## What VantageCloud is

Teradata offers solutions to keep your data warehouse or data lakehouse in the three leading Service Cloud Providers: AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform. The umbrella term for this offering is VantageCloud.
* VantageCloud Lake (VCL or Lake) is the Teradata cloud-native database. It is ideal for both data lakehouses and data warehouses. Furthermore, Lake is built to optimise cost storage while speeding up the response to your critical queries.
* VantageCloud Enterprise (VCE) is the solution to hosting large data warehouses in the Cloud. It is meant to optimise performance and uses the traditional Teradata architecture.

Lake and Enterprise offer the complete set of Teradata analytic functions for Machine Learning, Data Science, and traditional reporting in a bundle called ClearScape Analytics.

## Lake infographics: the content of this repository

In this repository, I gather high-resolution infographics, cheat sheets and other assets, each dedicated to explaining a VantageCloud **Lake** feature or the different setup options.

I published every asset in separate posts on [my blog](https://celiamuriel.com/) with further details. You have below a list with every article and a summary of its content:
* [VantageCloud Lake in a Nutshell](https://celiamuriel.com/vantagecloud-lake-in-a-nutshell/) summarises the critical VantageCloud Lake elements and the basis for using them for a quick start. The post shows the [VantageCloud Lake in a Nutshell infographic](https://github.com/CeliaMuriel/VantageCloud-Lake-infographics/blob/main/VantageCloud%20Lake%20in%20a%20Nutshell.jpg).
* [Flow in VantageCloud Lake - Cookbook to Make it Work in AWS](https://github.com/CeliaMuriel/VantageCloud-Lake-infographics/blob/main/Flow%20in%20VantageCloud%20Lake%20-%20Cookbook%20to%20Make%20it%20Work%20in%20AWS.pdf) gathers all my lessons learnt the first time I used Flow. You can learn more about Flow in the post [Flow in VantageCloud Lake: From Bust to Boom in Data Ingestion to Insights](https://celiamuriel.com/flow-in-vantagecloud-lake-from-bust-to-boom-in-data-ingestion-to-insights/).

This repository doesn't include an exhaustive list of all Lake configuration options and features, but it gathers the assets I made when needed.
